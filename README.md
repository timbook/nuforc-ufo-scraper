# NUFORC UFO Sighting Scraper

A webscraper for quickly pulling up-to-date UFO sighting data from NUFORC's data bank.

This data is used in a lot of interesting examples at coding bootcamps such as the one I work for, however, it was difficult to find updated data. I wrote this quick scraper to pull relevant data from https://nuforc.org/ and save it as a csv. I did not save the actual result of this scrape to avoid the wrath of NUFORC. The scrape takes about 5 minutes on my machine.
